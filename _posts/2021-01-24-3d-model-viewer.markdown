I built a 3D model viewer where user can import a wavefront .obj model, view the model, and navigating around (pan, zoom, rotate) using mouse and keyboard.
The project was built using C++ with Visual Studio IDE. To "talk" to the graphic drivers, the OpenGL API was employed. To help with importing model, I used Assimp - a cross-platform 3D model import library.

The source code can be found in [my Github](https://github.com/bao-ho/Cpp-OpenGL-3D-Model-Viewer).
