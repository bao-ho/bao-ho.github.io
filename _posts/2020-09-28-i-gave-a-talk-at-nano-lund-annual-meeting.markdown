I had the pleasure of presenting my work at [NanoLund Annual Meeting 2020](https://www.nano.lu.se/calendar/annual-meeting-2020). During the talk, I explained to the audience the challenges of sorting nano bio-particles at high throughput in a microfluidic, lab-on-chip system and dicussed solutions to these challenges. Wait until the end where you can see some interesting results on various types of nano particles.
