title: Simulation Demo at MSW 2016
---

I had a booth at Micronano System Workshop 2016, where I demonstrated the simulation part of my PhD work.

In this video, I showed the mixed translational and rotational motion of a sphere in a microfludic channel confined by an array of pillars. The simulation was setup using the fluid-structure interaction in COMSOL Multiphysics. The rotation of particles in pillar array as shown here is often overlooked in literature, leading to discrepancy between calculated and actual trajactories of the particles.
