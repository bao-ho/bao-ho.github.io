title: My javascript solutions to Codility training lessions
---

Though not being as extensive as Leetcode, [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/) provides free, categorized training lessons for those who are preparing for a coding interview.
Here are my solutions to all of these lessons. The codility total scores are 100% for most of the solutions. For some problems that I could not find the solutions by myself, the ideas were then taken from (mostly) the legendary stackoverflow.
