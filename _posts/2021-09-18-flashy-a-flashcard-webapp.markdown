title: Flashy - a flashcard webapp
---

I made a minimal website where users can study Swedish vocabulary using flashcards with personalized progress based on spaced-repetition technique.

At the frontend, I only employed plain HTML/CSS/Javascript and HammerJS for handling touch gestures.
At the backend, NodeJS + ExpressJS were used as web framework, MongoDB + Mongoose for database, and PassportJS for authentication.
The webapp is hosted as a free project on Heroku ([Svenskakort](https://svenskakort.herokuapp.com/)) . The source code can be found on [my Github](https://github.com/bao-ho/js-flash-card).
