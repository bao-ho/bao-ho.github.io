During daytime, I am a software engineer at [Qlik](https://www.qlik.com/us/), working with charts, visualisation, and frontend development.

In the afternoon, you might find me jogging around and enjoying nature or pushing weight in a gym. In the evening, I whip my lazy ass into learning all sorts of stuff from Web Dev, Data Science, AI, or Math and Physics.
